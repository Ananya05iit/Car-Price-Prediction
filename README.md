# Car-Price-Prediction

This is a machine learning model using dataset from kaggle as car price prediction and I have trained my model with linear regression.
Firstly I have analysed my data and then performed feature scaling. Then I found the parameters w and b using gradient descent and a large learning rate so that the value of the parameter converges faster.
Using the w_norm and b_norm obtained from the gradient descent, I calculated cost and the prediction of prices of car and then plottedd the same.
This is the first learning model I trained and seeing that the value predicted is quite close to the real value I am quite satisfoed with my machine learning preject :)
